I’m @pi6688 and I'm a PhD student in _De novo_ enzyme design.

I am using this profile to post published literature code and methodologies with additional personal programmes that I have designed.

The code I post will be a mixture of Lua, Python, C++, MATLAB and MySQL depending upon the application with perhaps some LaTeX.
