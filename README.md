I’m @pi6688 and I'm a PhD student in _De novo_ enzyme design.
I am using this profile to post personal and research programmes that I have designed.
The code I post will be a mixture of Lua, Python, C++, MATLAB and MySQL depending upon the application with perhaps some LaTeX.
I can be reached at pi6688@protonmail.com if needed.
